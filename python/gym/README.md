# Toy RL

### Overview

This is a toy setting for RL. We aim to solve path finding problems in Mazes. Those mazes are defined in mullerenv.py.
Then a features extractor for state representation is defined in feature extractot.

Finally, two scripts for training and making inference are available :

### Learning:

```
./train_muller.py | tee mullersac.log
```

### Predict:

```
./predict_muller.py
```
