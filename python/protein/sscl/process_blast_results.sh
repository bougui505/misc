# This script takes the file blast_results.txt.gz as input.
# blast_results.txt.gz is the compressed raw output file of blastp program
# the format is the following:
# 101d_A  2oxv_C  100.000 12      0       0       1       12      2       13      3.2     24.3
# 101d_A  1qri_M  100.000 12      0       0       1       12      2       13      3.2     24.3
# The script read only column 1 and 2 and put in the same lines elements of column 2 based on the value of column 1,
# which is placed in the first element of the line
# The processing of the 2 lines above gives the following result:
# 101d_A 2oxv_C 1qri_M

set -e  # exit on error
set -o pipefail  # exit when a process in the pipe fails
set -o noclobber  # prevent overwritting redirection

# Full path to the directory of the current script
