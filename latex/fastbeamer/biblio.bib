    abstract = "{Advances in microscopy instruments and image processing algorithms have led to an increasing number of Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps. However, building accurate models for the EM maps at 3–5 Å resolution remains a challenging and time-consuming process. With the rapid growth of deposited EM maps, there is an increasing gap between the maps and reconstructed/modeled three-dimensional (3D) structures. Therefore, automatic reconstruction of atomic-accuracy full-atom structures from EM maps is pressingly needed.We present a semi-automatic de novo structure determination method using a deep learning-based framework, named as DeepMM, which builds atomic-accuracy all-atom models from cryo-EM maps at near-atomic resolution. In our method, the main-chain and Cα positions as well as their amino acid and secondary structure types are predicted in the EM map using Densely Connected Convolutional Networks. DeepMM was extensively validated on 40 simulated maps at 5 Å resolution and 30 experimental maps at 2.6–4.8 Å resolution as well as an Electron Microscopy Data Bank-wide dataset of 2931 experimental maps at 2.6–4.9 Å resolution, and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms including RosettaES, MAINMAST and Phenix. Overall, our DeepMM algorithm obtained a significant improvement over existing methods in terms of both accuracy and coverage in building full-length protein structures on all test sets, demonstrating the efficacy and general applicability of DeepMM.http://huanglab.phys.hust.edu.cn/DeepMM.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are key elements in numerous biological pathways and the subject of a growing number of drug discovery projects including against infectious diseases. Designing drugs on PPI targets remains a difficult task and requires extensive efforts to qualify a given interaction as an eligible target. To this end, besides the evident need to determine the role of PPIs in disease-associated pathways and their experimental characterization as therapeutics targets, prediction of their capacity to be bound by other protein partners or modulated by future drugs is of primary importance.We present InDeep, a tool for predicting functional binding sites within proteins that could either host protein epitopes or future drugs. Leveraging deep learning on a curated dataset of PPIs, this tool can proceed to enhanced functional binding site predictions either on experimental structures or along molecular dynamics trajectories. The benchmark of InDeep demonstrates that our tool outperforms state-of-the-art ligandable binding sites predictors when assessing PPI targets but also conventional targets. This offers new opportunities to assist drug design projects on PPIs by identifying pertinent binding pockets at or in the vicinity of PPI interfaces.The tool is available on GitLab at https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/InDeep/InDeep.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

        abstract = {Summary
Chemical crosslinking can identify the neighborhood relationships between specific amino-acid residues in proteins. The interpretation of crosslinking data is typically performed using single, static atomic structures. However, proteins are dynamic, undergoing motions spanning from local fluctuations of individual residues to global motions of protein assemblies. Here we demonstrate that failure to explicitly accommodate dynamics when interpreting crosslinks structurally can lead to considerable errors. We present a method and associated software, DynamXL, which is able to account directly for flexibility in the context of crosslinking modeling. Our benchmarking on a large dataset of model structures demonstrates significantly improved rationalization of experimental crosslinking data, and enhanced performance in a protein-protein docking protocol. These advances will provide a considerable increase in the structural insights attainable using chemical crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry.},

Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are ‘discoverable’ through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community.

To aid in the analysis and annotation of these complexes, we have developed SSEhunter, a tool for the quantitative detection of α-helices and β-sheets. Based on density skeletonization, local geometry calculations and a template-based search, SSEhunter has been tested and validated on a variety of simulated and authentic subnanometer resolution density maps. The result is a robust, user-friendly approach that allows users to quickly visualize, assess and annotate intermediate resolution density maps. Beyond secondary structure element identification, the skeletonization algorithm in SSEhunter provides secondary structure topology, potentially useful in leading to structural models of individual molecular components directly from the density.},

Despite the rapidly growing number of macromolecular structures, few tools exist for modeling and annotating structures in the range of 3-10Å resolution. To address this need, we have developed a number of utilities specifically targeting subnanometer resolution density maps. As part of the 2010 Cryo-EM Modeling Challenge, we demonstrated two of our latest de novo modeling tools, Pathwalking and Gorgon, as well as a tool for secondary structure identification (SSEHunter) and a new rigid-body/flexible fitting tool in Gorgon. In total, we submitted 30 structural models from ten different subnanometer resolution data sets in four of the six challenge categories. Each of our utlities produced accurate structural models and annotations across the various density maps. In the end, the utilities that we present here offer users a robust toolkit for analyzing and modeling protein structure in macromolecular assemblies at non-atomic resolutions.},

Fewer than a third of the 14,849 known protein families have at least one member with an experimentally determined structure. This leaves more than 5000 protein families with no structural information. Protein modeling using residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary data has been successful in modeling unknown structures, but it requires large numbers of aligned sequences. Ovchinnikov et al. augmented such sequence alignments with metagenome sequence data (see the Perspective by Söding). They determined the number of sequences required to allow modeling, developed criteria for model quality, and, where possible, improved modeling by matching predicted contacts to known structures. Their method predicted quality structural models for 614 protein families, of which about 140 represent newly discovered protein folds.
Science, this issue p. 294; see also p. 248
Despite decades of work by structural biologists, there are still {\textasciitilde}5200 protein families with unknown structure outside the range of comparative modeling. We show that Rosetta structure prediction guided by residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary information can accurately model proteins that belong to large families and that metagenome sequence data more than triple the number of protein families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling. We then integrate metagenome data, contact-based structure matching, and Rosetta structure calculations to generate models for 614 protein families with currently unknown structures; 206 are membrane proteins and 137 have folds not represented in the Protein Data Bank. This approach provides the representative models for large protein families originally envisioned as the goal of the Protein Structure Initiative at a fraction of the cost.
Combining metagenome data with protein structure prediction generates models for 614 families with unknown structures.

Here we show that protein secretion by the type VI secretion system of Vibrio cholerae requires the action of a dynamic intracellular tubular structure that is structurally and functionally homologous to contractile phage tail sheath. Time-lapse fluorescence light microscopy reveals that sheaths of the type VI secretion system cycle between assembly, quick contraction, disassembly and re-assembly. Whole-cell electron cryotomography further shows that the sheaths appear as long tubular structures in either extended or contracted conformations that are connected to the inner membrane by a distinct basal structure. These data support a model in which the contraction of the type VI secretion system sheath provides the energy needed to translocate proteins out of effector cells and into adjacent target cells.},
